A backup of my custom PocketCHIP configuration.

I am using the [sway](https://swaywm.org) compositor, and the
[foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) terminal emulator.

In this repo you will find the sway, foot, and xkb configurations, as
well as the list of packages I had installed at the time of this
writing, in case you have trouble replicating my work.

I am running the updated rootfs by [macromorgan](tbd).

The sway configuration is a minimalist dock, containing just the
workspace switcher, date-time, and battery percentage. Interaction
with sway is modal: tap the power key, and then press another key to
perform a window action. See the .config/sway/config for the cheat
sheet, I did my best to make it legible.
